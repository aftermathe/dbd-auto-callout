# DBD Auto Callout
A program for Dead by Daylight which will automatically display the callout map for the map you're playing on.

# How to Use
Download the latest release from releases, then extract. Run the .exe. The callout map should update when you spawn into a map and its text label is visible. Press ']' to close the program.
